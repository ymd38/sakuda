# sakuda

A self-hosted DAST (dynamic application security testing) app. Register a
**site**, run scans against it with **nuclei**, **ZAP API** (active scan
against an OpenAPI spec), **ZAP frontend** (spider + baseline against a
seed page) and/or **Dalfox** (bounded reflected/DOM XSS), and browse the
results from the UI: per-engine findings, a
diff against the previous scan, Markdown export, and history charts.
**Discovery** is separate from scanning: ZAP's spider crawls the site, you
review the URLs it found and save the ones you want as target paths, and
nuclei scans that saved list on every run — no need to crawl again until the
site changes.

MVP scope: sites → scans → per-engine reports. See
[Not in this MVP](#not-in-this-mvp) for what's deliberately out.

## Quick start (Docker)

Everything — the app, nuclei + templates, and ZAP — ships in one image.
`docker-compose.yml` + `Makefile` wrap the commands; every port and secret is
read from `.env`.

```bash
make env      # .env from .env.example with a fresh SAKUDA_ENCRYPTION_KEY
make build    # build the image (10–20 min the first time)
make up       # start → http://localhost:3001
make logs     # follow logs · make restart · make ps
make down && make up   # recreate sakuda (e.g. after make build)
make down     # stops sakuda only — the data volume and Juice Shop are untouched
```

`make help` lists every target. Without make:

```bash
docker compose up -d sakuda          # same thing, reads .env
# or plain docker:
docker build -t sakuda .
docker run -d --name sakuda -p 127.0.0.1:3001:3000 --shm-size=1g \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e SAKUDA_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  -v sakuda-data:/data \
  sakuda
```

### Ports

The container always listens on **3000**; the host-side ports come from
`.env` so sakuda can coexist with other local stacks:

| `.env` variable  | Default     | What                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SAKUDA_PORT`    | `3001`      | sakuda UI/API (`make up`, `make dev`)                                  |
| `JUICESHOP_PORT` | `4001`      | OWASP Juice Shop dry-run target (`make juice-up`, own compose project) |
| `SAKUDA_BIND`    | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for published ports — keep it loopback-only               |

Override per invocation with `make up SAKUDA_PORT=3005`.

- **Trust model: sakuda has no authentication.** Anyone who can reach the
  port can read/create/modify sites (including their configured headers) and
  start scans against arbitrary hosts. Bind it to loopback only (the default
  `SAKUDA_BIND=127.0.0.1`) or put it behind an authenticating reverse proxy —
  never publish it on `0.0.0.0` on a shared or internet-facing host.
- **Keep the key.** `SAKUDA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` encrypts stored request headers
  (Cookie/Bearer/etc.) at rest. If you lose it, those headers become
  permanently unreadable — write it down somewhere safe (e.g. a password
  manager), it is not recoverable from the data volume.
- **Memory:** give Docker Desktop **6–8 GB** of RAM — the ZAP frontend engine
  (`zap-fe`) is the heaviest consumer and will fail or be OOM-killed on less.
- **Target URLs on your host machine**: when a site's base URL is
  `http://localhost:PORT` (or `127.0.0.1`), sakuda automatically rewrites it
  to `host.docker.internal` for engines running inside the container — no
  extra configuration needed, as long as the container was started with
  `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` (as above). The Firefox that
  ZAP's Ajax spider drives is also told to treat that alias as a **secure
  context** (`dom.securecontext.allowlist`): a plain-http, non-localhost
  origin has no `crypto.randomUUID` / `crypto.subtle` / service workers, and
  an SPA that touches one of them while bootstrapping auth would otherwise
  fail silently and crawl as an anonymous visitor.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
make env                    # .env with a fresh key (or: cp .env.example .env && pnpm keygen)
```

nuclei, katana and dalfox run as native binaries and ZAP runs via Docker in dev:

- Install nuclei locally (e.g. `go install github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest`)
  and clone [nuclei-templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates),
  then point `.env` at them: `SAKUDA_NUCLEI_BIN`, `SAKUDA_NUCLEI_TEMPLATES`.
- Install katana locally (`go install github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@v1.7.0`,
  the version pinned in the Dockerfile) and point `SAKUDA_KATANA_BIN` at it. Without
  it, discovery still works on ZAP alone and reports the missing binary as a warning.
- Install dalfox locally (`brew install dalfox`, or download the pinned
  v3.2.2 release) and point `SAKUDA_DALFOX_BIN` at it. Without it, a scan that
  selects the XSS engine fails that engine run with a clear "binary not found"
  error; the other engines are unaffected.
- ZAP runs inside Docker via `scripts/zap-docker.sh` (no local ZAP install
  needed). Set in `.env`:
  ```
  SAKUDA_ZAP_CMD=./scripts/zap-docker.sh
  SAKUDA_ZAP_WORKDIR=/zap/wrk
  SAKUDA_ZAP_LOCALHOST_ALIAS=host.docker.internal
  ```
  Note: sending SIGKILL to the `docker run` client does not stop the ZAP
  container — SIGTERM is proxied through to it, and sakuda's engine runner
  sends SIGTERM first, so a graceful stop/timeout works as expected.

Then:

```bash
make dev            # nuxt dev on SAKUDA_PORT → http://localhost:3001
make test           # unit + component tests
make e2e            # API e2e tests
make lint · make typecheck · make check (all three)
make juice-up       # Juice Shop on JUICESHOP_PORT as a scan target · make juice-down
```

Juice Shop is a separate compose project (`targets/juice-shop/compose.yml`,
project `sakuda-juice-shop`) that reads the same `.env`, so `make down` /
`make reset-data` never touch it. Without make:
`docker compose --env-file .env -f targets/juice-shop/compose.yml up -d`.
Recreating the container (`make juice-down`) resets its accounts and tokens.
Upgrading from a checkout where Juice Shop lived in `docker-compose.yml`:
remove the old container once with `docker rm -f sakuda-juice-shop`, then
`make juice-up`.

(`pnpm dev --port 3001`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:e2e`, `pnpm run lint`,
`pnpm run typecheck` underneath.)

## Scan data on disk

`data/scans/<scanId>/<engine>/` keeps each engine's raw logs and reports
(stdout/stderr, ZAP's plan/report JSON, nuclei's JSONL output). This can
contain target application data (response fragments, discovered paths) —
treat the `data/` directory as sensitive, do not commit it or share it
outside the team that owns the scanned target.

**Retention model:** there is no per-scan expiry — a site's scan artifacts
live on disk for as long as the site exists, and are deleted (best-effort)
when the site itself is deleted.

## Scanning — engines and active checks

A scan runs one or more engines against a site; when all of them are
selected they run in this fixed order, each with its own time budget:

1. **ZAP API (active)** — drives ZAP's active scan from the site's OpenAPI
   spec (`openapiUrl` / `openapiJson`, plus a spec sakuda generates from saved
   non-GET targets when active checks are on). This is where documented
   endpoints get injection / redirect / SQLi coverage; the image pins ZAP's
   `ascanrulesBeta` add-on for NoSQL (MongoDB) and LDAP injection rules.
2. **ZAP Frontend (baseline)** — traditional + Ajax spiders from the seed
   page, a passive baseline scan, and a DOM-XSS probe over hash routes. The
   heaviest engine (it drives a real Firefox); size Docker's RAM as noted
   above.
3. **Dalfox (XSS)** — a bounded reflected + DOM(AST) cross-site-scripting
   pass over the saved GET targets. It runs **only when active injection
   checks are on**; otherwise its engine run is recorded as _skipped_ (not
   failed), and it is off by default in the engine picker. Mining, deep scan,
   stored/blind XSS, remote payload sources and external-JS fetching are all
   disabled — it consumes the curated target list, not a recon dump, and only
   a _verified_ finding is reported `high` (a reflection-only signal never is).
   It does not replace the ZAP frontend DOM-XSS probe over hash routes.
4. **Nuclei** — template scanning against the saved target paths (see
   [Discovery](#discovery--filling-the-target-list)).

**sakuda sends attack traffic — only scan targets you own or are authorized
to test.** The ZAP API engine active-scans the documented endpoints on every
run by design, independent of the toggle below.

**Active injection checks (per site).** This toggle broadens what the engines
are allowed to attack: mutating-method requests to saved targets, nuclei's
DAST fuzzing templates (GET and generated non-GET), ZAP's frontend active
scan, the Dalfox XSS engine, and form-submitting discovery (katana `-aff`,
ZAP `postForm`). With it off, those are held back. For a target that is not on your own machine, sakuda
additionally requires you to confirm you are authorized (`nonLocalConfirmed`)
before active checks take effect. Individual high-risk nuclei template groups
(known-CVE exploits, command-injection / RCE, denial-of-service) are each
opted in separately on the site form.

**How nuclei spends its time.** One nuclei run has up to three phases sharing
`SAKUDA_NUCLEI_MAX_MINUTES`:

1. **DAST** — fuzzing templates on the GET targets (active checks only). Runs
   first: it is short and catches the high-signal cases (SQLi, command
   injection).
2. **Signature** — the `http` template tree on the GET targets. The long
   phase.
3. **OpenAPI** — fuzzing the saved non-GET endpoints via a generated spec
   (active checks only).

Each phase reserves a floor of time for the phases still to come, so a slow
target can't let one phase consume the whole budget and leave the rest at 0%.
Lower `SAKUDA_NUCLEI_CONCURRENCY` for a slow target.

**Partial runs are reported honestly.** If an engine hits its time limit it is
marked _stopped at limit_ rather than shown as a clean finish, and it keeps
whatever it found up to that point. The scan page shows, per engine, its
status, elapsed / total time and the limit it ran under, alongside the
findings, a diff against the previous scan, and a Markdown export.

## Discovery — filling the target list

Nuclei does not crawl; it scans exactly the **target paths** saved on the
site (`/path` or `api:/path`, relative to the base URLs). On the site page:

1. **Discover URLs** runs ZAP's traditional + Ajax spiders from the seed path
   (each for up to `zapFeSpiderMaxMinutes`, with the site's headers) and dumps
   ZAP's site tree — every URL the crawl requested, not only the ones that
   raised an alert. In parallel, **katana** crawls the same seeds in static
   mode with JS-bundle parsing (`-jc`, depth 3, same time budget, same
   headers): it picks up the API paths that only exist as string literals in
   the app's bundles (`/api/Feedbacks`, `/rest/user/whoami`, …), which no
   spider ever clicks its way to. The two lists are merged (ZAP wins a tie)
   and each row shows its `source` — `spider`, `ajax` or `katana`. katana is
   scoped to the front host (`-fs fqdn`), so an `apiBaseUrl` on another origin
   is left to ZAP; and if katana fails or is missing, the ZAP result is kept
   and the failure is shown as a warning. Off-origin URLs, static assets,
   socket.io transports, stack-trace pseudo-paths, `excludePaths` matches and
   katana's regex artifacts (strings it scraped but never requested, `%5C%22`
   fragments) are dropped; the panel shows how many and why.
2. Tick the URLs you want scanned (everything not yet saved is pre-selected),
   add paths by hand if you like, and **Save to targets**. Saving appends to
   the list and never duplicates a path.
3. Start a scan. Nuclei uses the saved list; ZAP frontend still crawls from
   the seed path itself.

**Non-GET endpoints.** With active checks on, discovery also observes the
value-free _shape_ of the non-GET requests the app makes — a badge like
`form {email, password}` or `json {email, password}`, never the captured
values — and you approve those alongside the URLs. sakuda turns the approved
shapes into a generated OpenAPI spec so nuclei and ZAP API can fuzz those
endpoints, which is how an authenticated `POST /rest/user/login` becomes
reachable to injection checks without you hand-writing a spec.

**Single-page apps behind a login.** Header injection authenticates the
_requests_, but an SPA decides whether it is logged in from what it finds in
`localStorage` / `sessionStorage` / cookies — so with headers alone ZAP's
browser renders the anonymous UI and never reaches the basket, profile, …
pages or the APIs behind them. Register those values as **Browser storage**
on the site (kind + name + value; stored encrypted like headers, write-only
in the API) and sakuda seeds them into ZAP's browser before every Ajax
spider run (discovery and ZAP frontend) via a Selenium `browserLaunched`
script that is written 0600 for the run and deleted afterwards. For OWASP
Juice Shop that is `localStorage token = <JWT>` plus `sessionStorage bid =
<basket id>` from `POST /rest/user/login`.

**Discovery seeds.** _Discovery seed paths_ (one per line, hash routes such
as `/#/search?q=apple` are fine) start one Ajax spider each; empty falls
back to the ZAP frontend seed path.

**"The app made no client-side API calls" warning.** A discovery whose Ajax
spider ran but produced no app-initiated API call (only assets and HTML
pages) usually means the SPA never booted or stayed anonymous — which
otherwise looks like a clean crawl with no warnings. Discovery flags it so
repeated empty runs are not mistaken for success. Check, in order: the
secure-context alias (`SAKUDA_ZAP_LOCALHOST_ALIAS`, needed so
`crypto.randomUUID` and friends work over a loopback origin), the site's
**Browser storage** login values, and — importantly — that the app's own
JavaScript is not being excluded. **Do not put `/_nuxt/*` (or your
framework's asset path) in `excludePaths` on a dev server:** ZAP will refuse
to fetch the bundle, the SPA cannot start, and every discovery comes back
empty. `excludePaths` is for endpoints that end the session or change data,
not for static assets (those are dropped from the target list automatically).

A site runs one job at a time: a discovery is refused while a scan is
queued/running and vice versa. Discovery artifacts (ZAP plan, logs, the
site-tree dump; katana's seeds, logs and JSONL under `katana/`) live under
`<data dir>/discoveries/<id>` and are removed with the site.
