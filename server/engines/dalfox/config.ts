 * (Authorization / Cookie headers) go here rather than on argv so they never
 * appear in the process list. The whole bounded profile is expressed here as
 * one audited surface: mining, deep scan, stored/blind XSS, remote payloads
 * and external-JS fetching are all disabled; the AST DOM-XSS pass (0 extra
 * requests) is left on because it is the reason to run dalfox at all.
 *
 * The returned object is written 0600 and removed after the run.
